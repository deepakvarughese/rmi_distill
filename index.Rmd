I am a researcher working on the synthesis of porphyrins. I am interested in the applications of porphyrins in optoelectronics and photodynamic therapy.  I have experience working on pi-Extended Porphyrinoids and bis-Carbaporphyrinoids incorporating Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH’s) and its applications.
